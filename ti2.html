                        bx + c), when "a" cannot be factored out by GCF, it's still possible to factor the trinomial by using
                        the "Slip and Slide" method. The first step of this method is to "slip" a to the end of the trinomial
                        and multiply it by c. You then would factor the trinomial. Next, you have to divide both factors by
                        the value you have "slipped" in the first step. Reduce fractions and "slide" any denominators up
                        next to the variable. You can then distribute it to check if it's correct

                    <p><div class="center4">• Example 1: 5m^2 - 17n + 6    </p></div>
                    
                    <p> <div class="center4">Since there is no GCF in this equation, you would use the method "slip and slide". The first step
                        is to multiply 6 by 5. The equation you would get is m^2 - 17m + 30. Since you can factor this
                        trinomial, you then have to find the two integers that can be (-17) when added and (30) when
                        multiplied. The two integers are (-15) and (-2). You would then write two binomials, which are (m
                        - 15) (m - 2). The last step is to divide these two numbers by the number by 5. The answer is (m
                        -3) (5m - 2). Since ⅖ is not a whole number, you would "slide" the 5 to the other side.

                    <p> <div class="center4"> First, you multiply (6) by (-12). Next, you find the two integers and make two
                        binomials. You would write (×+9) (x-8) . The last step is to divide both numbers by 6. The
                        answer is (2x + 3) (3x -4)                                                                  </p></div>

                    <p> <div class="center4">The first step is to find the GCF. For this equation, it is 2. After finding it, you would write 2(6x^2 + x-1) since you can't factor it, you multiply 1 by 6. You then write two binomials after finding the two integers. You would write 2(x+3) (-2). The last step is to divide both numbers by 6. The
                        answer is 2(2x + 1) (x - 3). After finding the answer, you can then distribute it in order to see if it is
                        correct.

                <div class="center6"> <em>-  There are certain steps to do in order to factor the
                    difference of squares. You have to make sure that they actually are different squares, otherwise,
                    you can't factor them. In order to make sure you can, you have to first see if they have a
                    subtraction sign (-) and that you are able to square root both terms. The rule to use when
                    factoring is a^2 - b^2=(a+b)(a-b). You then have to check your work by distributing.

                <p><div class="center4">• Example 1: 81 - x^2    </p></div>
                
                <p> <div class="center4">make sure that it has a subtraction sign. The next thing is to
                    make sure that you can square root them. Since both rules apply to this example, we are able to
                    factor it. The square root of 81 is 9. After factoring it, you should get (9+x) (9-x).

                <p><div class="center4">•    Example 2: k^2+ 25    </p></div>
                
                <p> <div class="center4"> For this one, even though you can square root both of them, there is a plus sign instead
                    of a subtraction sign. The answer for this is Prime since you are not able to factor it.                      </p></div>

                <p><div class="center4">• Example 3: 80n^4 - 125n^2    </p></div>
                
                <p> <div class="center4">For this one, you have to look for the GCF first. The GCF is 5n^2. So you would
                    write 5n^2(16n^2 - 25). Next, you factor in the remaining difference of squares. The answer is
                    5n^2(4n -5) (4n +5). After finding the answer to each question, you can distribute it to make
                    sure that it is right.

                    <div class="center6"> <em>-  For factoring trinomials of the form (x^2 + bx +
                        c), you would have to find two integers that are able to 'b' and multiply to 'c'.                        
                        </em></p></div>
        
                    <p><div class="center4">• Example 1: a^2 + 10a + 24    </p></div>
                    
                    <p> <div class="center4">The two integers that have a product of 24 and the sum of 10 are 4 and 6.After finding the integers, you would write two binomials using these integers. The two binomials
                        for these integers are (a+4) (a+6). You can then distribute to check.

                    <p><div class="center4">•    Example 2: W^2 - 16w + 48    </p></div>
                    
                    <p> <div class="center4"> The two integers in this equation will be (-4) and (-12). You then make two
                        binomials, which are (w-4) (w-12).                                             </p></div>

                    <p><div class="center4">• Example 3: 3a^3 + 30a^2 + 63a    </p></div>
                    
                    <p> <div class="center4">The GCF for this equation is 3a. After finding that out, you write 3a(a^2 +
                        10a + 21). The next step is to factor the trinomials. The two integers are 7 and 3. The last step
                        is to make two binomials. The answer to this equation is 3a(a + 7) (a + 3).

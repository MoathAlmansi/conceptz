<p><div class="center4">-    Polynomials are classified according to their degree and the number of terms. A polynomial with 1 term is a monomial. A polynomial with two terms is a binomial, and a polynomial with three terms is a trinomial. A polynomial may be categorized into five categories based on its degree. Constant (0) polynomial, linear (1) polynomial, quadratic (2) polynomial, and cubic (3) polynomial, quartic (4)  are the five types. The degree of polynomials should be a whole number. Negative exponent expressions are not polynomials.</p></div>

        <div class="center6"> <em>- To add polynomials we simply add any like terms together. Like terms are terms whose exponents and variables are the same. Step 1: Arrange each polynomial starting with the term with the highest degree in decreasing order of degrees. Step 2: Group the like terms and follow the order of operations from there.

</p></div>

<p> <div class="center4">Simplify (5a + 9b) + (6a – 2b)</p>
<p>To begin, remove the parenthesis. When adding, this is simple since there are no "minus" signals to pass via parentheticals. After that, you group similar terms according to their variables (keeping them in alphabetical order), and then you simplify:
</p>
<p>(5a + 9b) + (6a – 2b)</p>
<p>5a + 9b + 6a – 2b</p> 
<p>5a + 6a + 9b – 2b</p>
<p>11a + 7b</p>
